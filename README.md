# React-Flix - A netflix lookalike - 

This is a project i took the idea from my FullStack classes and decided to do it on react!

The project consists of a responsive site using react, and tailwind for the design with the following:

- JSON file and object oriented programming
- Dynamic movie list with details.
- Search bar that filters by name and gender
- Categories page that filters movies bt likes and score, using a clone from the main JSON file.
- Form with validations.
- About page with contact info to me :)
- Responsiveness
